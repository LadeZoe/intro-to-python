Ingredients
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups chocolate chips
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.

Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.

Fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of cold milk!
